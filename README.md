# Filters and Interceptors in Java EE 8

This is simple showcase for JAX-RS filters and interceptors, intentionally written in 'old' Java EE 8.

The code works fine as well for Jakarta EE. 

For Javakarta 9.x and later, for injecting the `ResourceInfo`, the `@Inject` can be used instead of the `@Context`.

No tests so far, I'll play with them in future (hopefully)
